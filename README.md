# USD-BTC-BCC-Conversions
Ignore the other lame not useful apps if I can't figure out how to get them off my repository.


Update. Couldn't figure out how to get them off repository. 


Update. Help.

Hello! I have never used Github before. I suppose that it pretty obvious seeing as I have a grade calculator from freshman
year, a 'Guess The Number' game that I followed along with in a Python book, and a few Binary / Decimal converters that 
took me much longer than they should have. 

However! If you ever want an idea for a fun project to start, Bitcoin / Bitconnect coin conversions are simple, utilize 
fundamental programming skills (such as data types, functions, GUI implementation, etc). Please keep in mind I am not by 
any means an expert programmer. Or a novice. Borderline still a beginner? Either way, I hope these are a few fun projects for 
new programmers to tackle, or a blast from the past to the veterans!
